PaintWeb is a Web application which allows users to draw inside the Web browser 
making use of new Web technologies. The project is undergoing heavy development 
for the purpose of having it integrated into Moodle and TinyMCE.

Requirements:

- A Web browser which implements the HTML 5 <canvas> 2D context API.
Known to work are: Opera 9.5+, Firefox 3+, Safari 3.1+, Konqueror 4.1+.
Each Web browser has its minor quirks.

Internet Explorer does not support Canvas. This application does not work in this Web browser.
