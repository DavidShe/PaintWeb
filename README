Paint.Web is a Web application which allows users to draw inside the Web browser, making use of new Web technologies. Currently it is in an early alpha stage with lots of work planned.

Requirements:

- A Web browser which implements the HTML 5 <canvas> 2D context API.
Known to work are: Opera 9.5+, Firefox 3+, Safari 3.1+, Konqueror 4.1+.
Each Web browser has its minor quirks.

Internet Explorer does not support Canvas. This application does not work in this Web browser.
