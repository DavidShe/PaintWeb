PaintWeb is a Web application which allows users to draw inside the Web browser 
making use of new Web technologies.

This folder holds the PaintWeb source code, documentation and the packaged 
PaintWeb build.


Requirements:

- A Web browser which implements the HTML 5 <canvas> 2D context API.
Known to work are: Opera 9.5+, Firefox 3+, Safari 3.1+, Konqueror 4.1+.
Each Web browser has its minor quirks.

Internet Explorer does not support Canvas. This application does not work in 
this Web browser.


You can use PaintWeb inside Moodle, or you may integrate PaintWeb into your 
project via TinyMCE. The "ext" folder holds a TinyMCE plugin which integrates 
PaintWeb into TinyMCE. Please check the documentation for further details:
