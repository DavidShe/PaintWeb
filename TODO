TODO:

- This project grew a lot more than initially expected, as such, I need to:

* Reorganize the code according to a broader vision;
* I must split my code into multiple files, into more robust JavaScript objects;
* Change the code comments to use a standard format (maybe JSDoc);
* Define some coding standards/guidelines. Currently I use tabs instead of spaces (having a width of 4 spaces), and non-wrapping lines. I should most likely adhere to stricter guidelines: word-wrapping at 80 chars, and 2 spaces instead of tabs, like the majority of code.

These are #1 priorities before further work can be done.

- I need to implement a proper GUI framework which uses SVG mainly, nicely integrating HTML and CSS. I will most likely not use jQuery, MooTools or other open-source JavaScript libraries because they are purely based on JS for animation effects. I want SVG.
- The GUI framework will be a separate open-source project which is expected to be used for my other project: my WYSIWYG editor. I want a unified user interface. At that time I will probably open-source the WYSIWYG editor as well.
- Paint.Web will switch to using the new GUI framework. Onwards I want to implement:

* hybrid undo system, not like now (storing ImageDatas);
* hybrid drawing: vectorial + bitmap drawing;
* layers;
* non-destructive filters;
* color gradients and fill patterns.

That should be all for now. Huh, lots of work to do.

Volunteers are needed! Please contact me if you want to help. Thank you! ;)
