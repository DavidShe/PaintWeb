Until the end of GSOC:

- Implement the ColorEditor extension.
- Application packaging. Currently, all the code is split across multiple files.  
For performance reasons, it's best to package all code in a single minified 
file.
- Integrate into TinyMCE and Moodle.
- Color theme for the OLPC XO.

After GSOC TODO:

- report browser bugs:
  - shadows are not applied in chrome when using drawImage()
  - elem.hasAttribute('data-whatever') fails to return true when it should do 
  so.
- write more tutorials/articles about paintweb.
- new tools: bucket, pencil v2 (avec pression).
- toolRegister creates instances of tool objects automatically.
- viewport resize handle.
- double-click on the tab bar to hide its content and only show a minimal list 
of tabs.
- allow canvas resize on the right and at the bottom - not just the south-east 
resize handle.
- allow single click on the image size, in the status bar to bring-up a panel 
which shows the image dimensions, where the user can crop and resize the image.
- fully implement the notion of background color.
- flip and rotate image.
- maybe selection rotate.
- maybe use .scale() and .translate() for selection manipulation.
- more per-tool settings. For example, do not share the lineWidth option between 
tools.
- tab reordering and grouping.

Further down the road:

* allow editing of multiple images in a single paintweb instance;
* hybrid undo system, not like now (storing ImageDatas);
* hybrid drawing: vectorial + bitmap drawing;
* layers;
* non-destructive filters;
* color gradients and fill patterns.

That should be all for now. Huh, lots of work to do.

Volunteers are needed! Please contact me if you want to help. Thank you! ;)
